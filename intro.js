/**What is Array ?
 * Array is a data structure. Array is Just A Collection.
 * Array is a data structure consisting of collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.
 *
 **Why we need Array? Why we don't use variable instead of array?
 * we can write variable with a single value but for storing multiple values and elements in a single variable we use array.
 *
 **How is Array?
 * we can access array elements by index.
 * for example we have 100 products. if we put data individually in a variable and then try to do something on these data it will be tough; but if we put all products in an array we can easy automate the data from array.
 *
 ** How does array work in JS?
 * step-1 create an instance : let arr = [];
 *
 * step-2 add elements :
 * arr[0] = 45
 * arr[1] = 30
 * arr[2] = 20
 * our array will look like : [45, 30, 20]
 *
 * step-3 access data when necessary:
 * let sum = 0;
 * sum += arr[0]
 * sum += arr[1]
 * sum += arr[2]
 *
 * JavaScript Array is Dynamic;
 * JavaScript Array can store any kind of data;
 *
 ** Multi-dimensional array
 * let multiDimenArr = [
 *  [2, 3, 4],
 *  [5, 6, 7]
 * ]
 * to get 6 from this array we need to write: multiDimenArr[j][i] => multiDimenArr[1][4] => 6;
 *
